Hi guys, this is the second version that I sent. In this opportunity I completed all the requirements:
-   Make sure turns are passed between the AI and the real player: I'm not sure if I did the best way possible, but the turn is being passed between the player and the AI
-   Come up with a way to represent the Tic tac toe algorithm in code: Done
-   Make sure no piece can be put on top of another piece: Done
-   Check for a win-lose or tie condition: Done
 -  The player turn: I added this little feature, at the top left corner you will see the current player turn, even though I'm having a little trouble with the text.

I also have a couple of ToDos:
-   Implement AiLevel, to differentiate between easy and hard
-   I would like to refactor a little more the code, I think I can separate the logics, for instance separate the management of the player and turns, from the management of the UI
-   A couple of refactor in some methods

The link to the repo is: https://github.com/fjaviergallucci/xrassessment. In case you would like to see the progress of the development.

Regards
Francisco
