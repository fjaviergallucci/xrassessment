Hi guys, I couldn't complete the task of "Make sure turns are passed between the AI and the real player", I started the assessment today. To be honest I completely forgot it. I manage to complete 3 tasks, and couldn't complete one. At first I tried to change a lot of code, starting by changing the TicTacToeAi class for BasePlayer class and extends for there. Then I realize I didn't have much time so I just created a basic service to manage the whole game business logic and that's what you will see in the video. Basically the code do:

- Come up with a way to represent the Tic tac toe algorithm in code
- Make sure no piece can be put on top of another piece
- Check for a win-lose or tie condition
